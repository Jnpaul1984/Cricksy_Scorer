Backend API running on <http://localhost:8000>

Installation

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd cricksy-scorer-ui
npm install
npm run dev
Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.

Scripts

npm run dev ‚Äî Start dev server with HMR

npm run build ‚Äî Production build

Full Simulation Test Run
------------------------

The repository includes an end-to-end simulation that replays the T20 fixture against the FastAPI API and the Cypress UI suite.

```
scripts/run-full-sim.sh
```

This helper runs `pytest` inside `backend/`, starts the API in an in-memory mode (no Postgres required), and executes `npm run test:e2e` from `frontend/`, which seeds the match and exercises the scoreboard, scoring console, and analytics pages.

Run the sequence manually if you prefer:

1. `export CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1`
2. `cd backend && pytest`
3. `python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`
4. In another terminal: `cd frontend && API_BASE=http://localhost:8000 VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000 npm run test:e2e`

Remember to set `CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1` any time you want the FastAPI app to use the in-memory store.

API Integration
Development: Proxied to FastAPI backend at <http://localhost:8000>

API calls to /api/* handled via Vite proxy
