🏏 Cricksy Scorer UI
Cricksy Scorer is a professional cricket scoring frontend built with Vue.js 3 and TypeScript, designed for schools, clubs, and custom games. It provides real-time scoring, flexible match setups, and engaging viewer experiences, all optimized for tablets and mobile devices.

Key Features (MVP – PR14)

Limited-overs & multi-day matches.

User-defined overs/days (no hardcoding of formats).

Mid-match overs reduction for weather delays (Duckworth–Lewis support planned).

Flexible Dismissals

All cricket dismissal types supported (incl. rare ones like hit wicket, timed out, obstructing field).

Mid-over bowler changes & “Retired Hurt” handling.

Strike & Bowler Logic

Automatic striker/non-striker rotation based on runs/extras.

Mid-over bowler replacement without breaking stats.

Offline-First Scoring
Scores queue when offline and sync automatically on reconnection.

“Pending” banner to alert scorers when disconnected.

Testing
-------

**📖 See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing documentation.**

The repository includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### Quick Start

**Backend Tests:**
```bash
cd backend
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/Cricksy_Scorer:$PYTHONPATH
export CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1
pytest
```

**Frontend Tests:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:unit
```

**E2E Tests:**
```bash
# Automated script
./scripts/run-full-sim.sh

# Or manually:
export CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/Cricksy_Scorer:$PYTHONPATH
cd backend && pytest
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 &
cd ../frontend
export API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
export VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
npm run build && npm run preview -- --port 3000 &
npx cypress run
```

**Important:** The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable must be set to the repository root for backend tests to work. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for details.
