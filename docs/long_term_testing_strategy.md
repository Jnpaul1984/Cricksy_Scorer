# Long-Term Testing Strategy for Cricksy Scorer

**Author**: Manus AI
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Project**: Cricksy Scorer Testing Infrastructure Overhaul

## 1. Test Coverage Expansion Plan

### 1.1. DLS Method Calculations

**Objective**: To verify the accuracy of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method calculations for rain-affected matches.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Test Data Acquisition**: Obtain official DLS calculation tables and a set of known match scenarios with official DLS-adjusted targets. These can be sourced from cricket boards or reputable sports analytics sites.
2.  **Unit Tests**: Develop a suite of unit tests that feed the known scenarios into the DLS calculation engine and assert that the output matches the official targets. These tests will cover various scenarios, including:
    *   Innings interruptions at different stages.
    *   Multiple interruptions in the same innings.
    *   Revised targets for the team batting second.
3.  **Integration Tests**: Create integration tests that simulate a rain-affected match, trigger the DLS calculation, and verify that the game state, match result, and commentary reflect the DLS adjustments correctly.

### 1.2. Multi-Day Matches

**Objective**: To ensure the application correctly handles the state and transitions of multi-day match formats (e.g., Test matches).

**Strategy**:

1.  **State Management Tests**: Develop tests that verify the application can correctly save and resume the match state across multiple days. This includes:
    *   End-of-day session management.
    *   Resumption of play on the following day with the correct batsmen, bowlers, and score.
    *   Handling of follow-on scenarios.
2.  **Integration Tests**: Create end-to-end integration tests that simulate a complete multi-day match, including declarations, follow-ons, and various session breaks.

### 1.3. Bowler Rotation

**Objective**: To ensure the backend correctly enforces bowler rotation rules and that the frontend provides a seamless user experience for managing bowlers.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Backend Tests**: The existing integration tests already cover the core backend logic for bowler rotation. We will augment these with more complex scenarios, such as bowler injuries and mid-over changes.
2.  **Frontend (UI/UX) Tests**: Once a frontend is developed, we will need to add tests to verify that the UI correctly guides the user in selecting bowlers and prevents invalid selections.

### 1.4. Performance Tests

**Objective**: To ensure the application can handle high-load scenarios and maintain responsiveness.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Load Testing**: Use a tool like `locust` or `k6` to simulate a high number of concurrent users interacting with the API. We will measure response times and error rates under load to identify bottlenecks.
2.  **Stress Testing**: Push the system to its limits to identify its breaking point and ensure it can recover gracefully.
3.  **Database Performance**: Analyze database query performance under load and optimize queries and indexes as needed.

## 2. CI/CD Integration Plan

### 2.1. GitHub Actions Workflow

**Objective**: To automate the testing process by running all tests on every commit.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Workflow File**: Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) in the repository.
2.  **Workflow Steps**: The workflow will consist of the following steps:
    *   **Checkout**: Check out the repository code.
    *   **Set up Python**: Set up the correct Python environment.
    *   **Install Dependencies**: Install all required Python packages.
    *   **Run Tests**: Execute the entire `pytest` suite with the `CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1` environment variable.

### 2.2. Coverage Tracking

**Objective**: To monitor test coverage and ensure it remains high.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Coverage Tool**: Integrate the `pytest-cov` plugin to generate a coverage report.
2.  **Codecov Integration**: Use a service like [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) to upload and visualize coverage reports. This will allow us to:
    *   See coverage data directly in pull requests.
    *   Track coverage trends over time.
    *   Identify areas of the codebase that lack sufficient test coverage.

## 3. Continuous Improvement Plan

### 3.1. Monitoring Test Failures

**Objective**: To ensure that test failures are identified and addressed promptly.

**Strategy**:

1.  **CI/CD Notifications**: Configure the CI/CD pipeline to send notifications (e.g., via Slack or email) whenever a build or test run fails.
2.  **Failure Triage**: Establish a process for triaging test failures to determine if they are due to a genuine bug, a flaky test, or an environment issue.

### 3.2. Testing New Features

**Objective**: To ensure that all new features are accompanied by comprehensive tests.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Encourage a TDD approach where tests are written before the feature is implemented.
2.  **Pull Request Reviews**: Make it a mandatory part of the pull request review process to check for the inclusion of new tests for any new features or bug fixes.

### 3.3. Documentation Updates

**Objective**: To keep all testing-related documentation up-to-date.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Living Documentation**: Treat test documentation as a living document that is updated alongside the code.
2.  **Automated Documentation**: Where possible, automate the generation of documentation from the code and tests themselves.
