Hi {{tester_name}},

## Welcome to the Cricksy Beta!

You've been hand-picked to join our private beta as a **{{role}}**. We chose you because of your cricket experience and because we trust you to give us honest, useful feedback.

This is an early version of Cricksy — not the final product. There will be rough edges, and that's exactly why we need you.

## What is Cricksy?

Cricksy is a modern cricket scoring and analytics platform built for schools, clubs, and academies. You can score matches ball-by-ball from any device, track player stats over time, share live scores with parents and fans, and unlock AI-powered insights that help coaches and analysts improve performance. Think of it as the tool you wish you'd had years ago.

## What We Want You to Test

We've put together a detailed Beta Tester Guide that walks you through exactly what to try:

📄 **[Cricksy Beta Tester Guide](./Cricksy_Beta_Tester_Guide.md)**

In short, we'd love you to:

- **Score at least 1–2 matches** ball-by-ball
- **Explore dashboards** — player profiles, team stats, analytics
- **Try the live viewer** — share a match link and check real-time updates
- **Break things** — push buttons, try edge cases, see what happens

Please submit your feedback by **{{beta_end_date}}**.

## How to Give Feedback

### Option 1: In-App Feedback Button (preferred)

Look for the **Feedback** button in the bottom-right corner of most pages. Click it, describe what happened, and attach a screenshot if you can.

### Option 2: Email

If the in-app button isn't working, email us directly:

📧 **support@cricksy-ai.com**

Please include:
- A short title (e.g. "Wicket button not responding")
- What you tried to do
- What actually happened
- Screenshot or error message if possible
