# Cricksy Beta Tester Guide

Welcome to the Cricksy private beta! 🏏

---

## 1. Welcome

**What is Cricksy?**

Cricksy is a modern cricket scoring and analytics platform designed for schools, clubs, and academies. It lets you score matches ball-by-ball, track player stats over time, and unlock AI-powered insights to help coaches and analysts improve performance.

**Why you were invited**

You're here because we trust your cricket knowledge and want your honest feedback. Whether you're a coach, analyst, or org admin, your perspective is invaluable in shaping what Cricksy becomes.

**This is a private beta**

What you're testing is *not* the final product. There will be rough edges, bugs, and missing features. That's expected — and that's exactly why we need you.

> **Please be brutally honest.** Tell us what's confusing, what's slow, what's broken, and what you wish existed. No feedback is too small or too harsh. We'd rather hear it now than after launch.

## 3. What We Want You to Test

Below are the key areas to explore. Use the checkboxes to track your progress. For each section, jot down your answers to the three questions at the end.

---

### A. Match Creation & Scoring Flow

This is the core of Cricksy — scoring a match ball-by-ball.

- [ ] Create a new match (choose format, overs, teams)
- [ ] Add or select teams and players
- [ ] Set the toss and choose batting/bowling order
- [ ] Score at least **5–10 overs** ball-by-ball
- [ ] Record different outcomes:
  - [ ] Singles, twos, threes, fours, sixes
  - [ ] Wickets (bowled, caught, LBW, run out, etc.)
  - [ ] Extras (wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes)
- [ ] Try special situations:
  - [ ] Retire hurt a batter
  - [ ] Change bowler mid-over
  - [ ] End of innings transition
- [ ] Complete a full match if time permits

**After testing, answer:**
1. What worked well?
2. What was confusing?
3. What felt slow or broken?

---

### B. Live Viewer & Sharing

Cricksy lets spectators and parents follow the match in real time.

- [ ] While a match is in progress, open the **public viewer** link
- [ ] Confirm that scores update automatically (no refresh needed)
- [ ] Copy the **share link** and open it:
  - [ ] In a different browser tab
  - [ ] On your phone
  - [ ] Send to a friend and ask if they see live updates
- [ ] Check the scoreboard layout — is it clear and readable?

**After testing, answer:**
1. What worked well?
2. What was confusing?
3. What felt slow or broken?

---

### C. Player Profiles & AI Insights

After playing some matches, individual player data starts building up.

- [ ] Navigate to a **player profile** (from match summary or team page)
- [ ] Review the stats summary (runs, wickets, averages, strike rates)
- [ ] Look at any **graphs or visualisations** (form charts, wagon wheels, etc.)
- [ ] Read any **AI-generated summaries** or insights
- [ ] Check if the data looks accurate based on what you scored

**After testing, answer:**
1. What worked well?
2. What was confusing?
3. What felt slow or broken?

---

### D. Analyst Workspace / Case Studies

*If you have Analyst Pro access*

This area lets you dig deeper into match data.

- [ ] Open the **Analyst Workspace**
- [ ] Filter matches by date, team, or player
- [ ] Open a **Case Study** for a specific match
- [ ] Review:
  - [ ] Phase breakdowns (powerplay, middle, death)
  - [ ] Impact visualisations and charts
  - [ ] Key moments and turning points
- [ ] Export or share data if that option is available

**After testing, answer:**
1. What worked well?
2. What was confusing?
3. What felt slow or broken?

---

### E. Org & Team Management

*If you're an Org Admin*

This section covers managing your organisation.

- [ ] View your **organisation dashboard**
- [ ] Check the **team list** — are your teams displayed correctly?
- [ ] Review **seat allocation** if applicable
- [ ] Add or invite a new team member (if the feature is available)
- [ ] Check that permissions make sense (who can score, who can view)

**After testing, answer:**
1. What worked well?
2. What was confusing?
3. What felt slow or broken?

---

## 4. How to Send Feedback

### Primary Method: In-App Feedback Button

Look for the **Feedback** button — it's usually in the bottom-right corner of most pages, or in the Settings menu.

When submitting feedback, please include:

| Field | What to Write |
|-------|---------------|
| **Short title** | e.g. "Wicket button didn't respond" |
| **What you tried to do** | e.g. "I tried to record a caught wicket" |
| **What actually happened** | e.g. "Nothing happened when I tapped the button" |
| **Screenshot or error text** | Attach if possible — even a phone photo helps |

### Backup Channel

If the in-app button isn't working or you prefer email:

📧 **support@cricksy-ai.com**

Use the same format above. Include your tester email so we can link it to your account.

## 5. Severity Levels

When reporting issues, tag them with a severity level so we can prioritise:

| Level | What It Means | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Cannot use the app at all | Can't log in, scoring crashes, data disappears |
| 🟠 **Major** | Feature works but is unreliable or confusing | Scores not updating live, wrong stats displayed |
| 🟡 **Minor** | Small annoyances, UI polish | Button looks off, text is hard to read |
| 🟢 **Nice to Have** | Ideas for future improvements | "Would be cool if you could..." |

---

## 6. Time Commitment & Expectations

### What we're asking for

- **Score 1–2 full matches** (or at least 10+ overs each)
- **Spend ~30 minutes** exploring dashboards, profiles, and analytics
- **Submit feedback** on at least 3 things (good or bad)

### Mindset

This is **not about winning or losing** — it's about **breaking the tool**. Try weird things. Click buttons you're not sure about. Push limits. The more you stress-test, the better we can make Cricksy.

### Feedback Deadline

Please submit your feedback by: **[TBD — Jason to set date]**

We'll review everything and share a summary of changes before the next update.
