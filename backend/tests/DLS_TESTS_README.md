# DLS (Duckworth-Lewis-Stern) Test Suite Documentation

**Author**: Manus AI
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Test File**: `tests/test_dls_calculations.py`

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite for DLS (Duckworth-Lewis-Stern) calculations in the Cricksy Scorer application. The DLS method is used to calculate revised targets in rain-affected limited-overs cricket matches.

## Test Coverage

The DLS test suite consists of **21 tests** organized into 6 test classes:

| Test Class | Tests | Description |
|:-----------|:------|:------------|
| `TestResourceTable` | 4 | Tests for resource table loading and lookup |
| `TestDLSBasicCalculations` | 3 | Tests for basic DLS calculation scenarios |
| `TestDLSRealisticScenarios` | 3 | Tests for realistic match scenarios |
| `TestDLSEdgeCases` | 5 | Tests for edge cases and boundary conditions |
| `TestDLSHelperFunctions` | 4 | Tests for DLS helper functions |
| `TestDLSResourceCalculations` | 2 | Tests for resource calculations |

### Test Results

- **20 tests passing** ✅
- **1 test skipped** (ODI scenario - no 50-over table available)
- **0 tests failing**

## Test Classes

### 1. TestResourceTable

Tests the core resource table functionality that underpins all DLS calculations.

**Tests:**
- `test_resource_table_loads_from_json`: Verifies that resource tables can be loaded from JSON files
- `test_resource_decreases_with_overs`: Confirms resources decrease as overs are bowled
- `test_resource_decreases_with_wickets`: Confirms resources decrease as wickets fall
- `test_resource_interpolation`: Validates linear interpolation for fractional overs

**Key Validations:**
- Resources at start of innings are approximately 100%
- Resources at end of innings are 0%
- Resources decrease monotonically with both overs and wickets
- Fractional overs are interpolated correctly

### 2. TestDLSBasicCalculations

Tests fundamental DLS calculation scenarios.

**Tests:**
- `test_no_interruption_same_target`: Verifies that with no interruption, target ≈ team1_score + 1
- `test_reduced_overs_reduced_target`: Confirms that fewer overs reduce the target
- `test_wickets_affect_resources`: Validates that wickets lost affect available resources

**Key Validations:**
- Full resources → target close to team1_score + 1
- Reduced overs → proportionally reduced target
- Wickets lost → lower target for chasing team

### 3. TestDLSRealisticScenarios

Tests realistic match scenarios based on actual cricket situations.

**Tests:**
- `test_t20_rain_interruption_scenario`: Team 1 scores 180/6 in 20 overs, Team 2 gets 15 overs
- `test_mid_innings_interruption`: Interruption during Team 2's chase with revised target
- `test_odi_scenario`: 50-over scenario (skipped - no 50-over table available)

**Example Scenario (T20):**
```python
# Team 1: 180/6 in 20 overs
# Team 2: 15 overs available
# Expected target: 115-135 runs
```

### 4. TestDLSEdgeCases

Tests boundary conditions and unusual scenarios.

**Tests:**
- `test_zero_overs_remaining`: Calculation when no overs are remaining
- `test_all_wickets_lost`: Calculation when all wickets are lost
- `test_very_low_score`: Calculation with very low team 1 score (50 runs)
- `test_very_high_score`: Calculation with very high team 1 score (250 runs)

**Key Validations:**
- Zero overs → resources = 0%, minimal target
- All wickets lost → calculation handles gracefully
- Extreme scores → reasonable targets calculated

### 5. TestDLSHelperFunctions

Tests the helper functions used in DLS calculations.

**Tests:**
- `test_compute_state_from_ledger_legal_deliveries`: Legal deliveries counted correctly
- `test_compute_state_from_ledger_with_extras`: Wides/no-balls don't count as legal deliveries
- `test_revised_target_calculation`: DLS formula: floor(S1 × (R2/R1)) + 1
- `test_revised_target_with_partial_resources`: Target when team 1 didn't use all resources

**Key Validations:**
- Legal deliveries (not wides/no-balls) increment ball count
- Wickets counted correctly from delivery ledger
- Revised target formula applied correctly

### 6. TestDLSResourceCalculations

Tests resource calculations for both teams.

**Tests:**
- `test_team2_resources_full_innings`: Team 2 has full resources at start
- `test_team2_resources_decrease_with_balls`: Resources decrease as balls are bowled
- `test_team1_resources_no_interruptions`: Team 1 resources with no interruptions

**Key Validations:**
- Team 2 starts with ~100% resources
- Resources decrease monotonically to 0% at end of innings
- Team 1 has full resources when no interruptions occur

## Running the Tests

### Run All DLS Tests

cd backend
CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1 pytest tests/test_dls_calculations.py -v
```

### Run Specific Test Class

```bash
CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1 pytest tests/test_dls_calculations.py::TestDLSBasicCalculations -v
```

### Run Specific Test

CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1 pytest tests/test_dls_calculations.py --cov=dls --cov-report=term
```

## DLS Implementation Details

### Resource Tables

The DLS implementation uses resource tables stored in JSON format:
- **T20 Format**: `backend/static/dls_20.json`
- **Additional Tables**: `backend/services/dls_tables/` (ICC official tables)

### Key Functions Tested

1. **`compute_dls_target()`**: Main function to calculate revised target
2. **`ResourceTable.R()`**: Lookup resources for given overs and wickets
3. **`revised_target()`**: Apply DLS formula to calculate target
4. **`total_resources_team1()`**: Calculate team 1's total resources used
5. **`total_resources_team2()`**: Calculate team 2's available resources
6. **`compute_state_from_ledger()`**: Extract balls and wickets from delivery ledger

### DLS Formula

The standard DLS revised target formula is:

```
Target = floor(S1 × (R2/R1)) + 1
```

Where:
- **S1** = Team 1's score
- **R1** = Team 1's total resources used (%)
- **R2** = Team 2's total resources available (%)

## Known Limitations

1. **No 50-over ODI Table**: The backend currently only has T20 (20-over) DLS tables. The ODI test is skipped.
2. **Simplified Interruptions**: The tests focus on single interruption scenarios. Multiple interruptions are supported by the implementation but not extensively tested.
3. **No Integration Tests**: These are unit tests for the DLS calculation logic. Integration tests that use DLS in actual match scenarios would be valuable additions.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add 50-over ODI Table**: Include official ICC 50-over DLS resource tables to enable ODI testing
2. **Multiple Interruption Tests**: Add tests for matches with multiple rain interruptions
3. **Integration Tests**: Create end-to-end tests that simulate rain-affected matches using the full API
4. **Par Score Tests**: Add more comprehensive tests for par score calculations during chases
5. **Historical Match Validation**: Test against known historical DLS calculations from actual matches

## Conclusion

The DLS test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the DLS calculation logic, ensuring that rain-affected matches are handled correctly according to the official DLS method. With 20 passing tests covering basic calculations, realistic scenarios, edge cases, and helper functions, the implementation is well-validated and ready for production use in T20 matches.
