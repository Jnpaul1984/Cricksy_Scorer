# Multi-Day Match Tests README

**Author**: Manus AI  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Project**: Cricksy Scorer

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the integration tests for multi-day (Test) match functionality in the Cricksy Scorer backend. These tests validate the system's ability to create and manage multi-day matches with unlimited overs.

## Test Suite

**File**: `backend/tests/integration/test_multi_day_matches.py`

This test suite contains **6 passing tests** that cover:

1. **Match Creation**:
   - Creating 5-day, 4-day, and 3-day matches
   - Verifying `match_type`, `days_limit`, and `overs_limit`

2. **Match Play**:
   - Playing an extended innings (60 overs) to simulate a Test match innings

3. **Match State**:
   - Verifying that match state (runs, overs, wickets) is correctly maintained
   - Confirming that the `deliveries` list is populated

## Key Findings

### Backend Capabilities

The backend has robust support for creating multi-day matches:
- **`match_type`**: `multi_day`
- **`days_limit`**: Can be set to any integer
- **`overs_limit`**: Can be set to `None` for unlimited overs

### API Structure

The `/games/{game_id}` endpoint provides a comprehensive view of the game state, including:
- `match_type`, `days_limit`, `overs_limit`
- `deliveries` list with details of each ball bowled
- `batting_scorecard` and `bowling_scorecard`

This allows for detailed verification of multi-day match functionality.

### Deferred Tests

Several tests were deferred to a future phase due to complexity:

- **Innings Transitions**: The `start_next_innings` method requires player IDs, which adds complexity to the tests.
- **Scorecard Validation**: The `batting_scorecard` and `bowling_scorecard` are available, but validating them in extended innings requires more complex test logic.

These tests can be implemented in the future as the backend evolves.

## Test Classes

1. **`TestMultiDayMatchCreation`**
   - `test_create_test_match`
   - `test_create_three_day_match`
   - `test_create_four_day_match`

2. **`TestMultiDayMatchPlay`**
   - `test_play_extended_innings`

3. **`TestMultiDayMatchState`**
   - `test_match_state_persistence`
   - `test_deliveries_list_populated`

## Running the Tests

To run these tests, use the following command from the `backend` directory:

```bash
CRICKSY_IN_MEMORY_DB=1 pytest tests/integration/test_multi_day_matches.py -v
```

## Conclusion

This test suite provides a solid foundation for validating multi-day match functionality. It confirms that the backend can create and manage multi-day matches, and provides a framework for adding more complex tests in the future.
