# Sample Test Data for Upload Feature

This directory contains sample images and documents for testing the upload and OCR functionality.

## Test Files

- `sample_scorecard_1.txt`: Sample scorecard in text format for basic testing
- `sample_scorecard_2.txt`: Another sample scorecard with different format

## Usage

These files can be used for:
1. Manual testing of the upload workflow
2. Integration tests
3. OCR parser development and validation

## Notes

- Real scorecard images should be added as needed
- Test images should be small (< 1MB) to avoid repository bloat
- For CI testing, these files are used as fixtures
