## ✅ Week 5 AI Integration - Tactical Suggestion Engine v1

**Status:** This feature was already fully implemented prior to this PR.

### 🔍 Verification Completed

**Backend Implementation:**
- ✅ `TacticalSuggestionEngine` class (450+ lines) - Comprehensive AI coaching engine
- ✅ **Four API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /tactical/games/{id}/suggestions/best-bowler` - Best bowler recommendation
  - `GET /tactical/games/{id}/suggestions/weakness-analysis` - Batter weakness detection
  - `GET /tactical/games/{id}/suggestions/fielding-setup` - Fielding position recommendations
  - `GET /tactical/games/{id}/suggestions/all` - Combined suggestions endpoint
- ✅ **Data Models:**
  - `BowlerProfile` - Bowler statistics with effectiveness scoring
  - `BatterProfile` - Batter statistics with weakness indicators
  - `ScoringZone` - Batter scoring patterns by pitch location
  - `BestBowlerSuggestion` - Bowler recommendation with confidence
  - `WeaknessAnalysis` - Delivery type recommendations
  - `FieldingSetup` - Fielding position suggestions
- ✅ **Best Bowler Selection:**
  - Effectiveness scoring (0-100) based on economy and wickets
  - Weakness matching (bowler style vs batter weakness)
  - Fatigue detection (recently bowled bowlers penalized)
  - Confidence-based recommendations
- ✅ **Weakness Analysis:**
  - Detects pace/spin/yorker/dot-ball vulnerabilities
  - Recommends delivery line (off/leg/middle stump)
  - Recommends delivery length (full/good/short/yorker)
  - Recommended speed for pace deliveries
  - Uses dismissal history for secondary weakness detection
- ✅ **Fielding Setup:**
  - Analyzes batter scoring zones (line + length)
  - Maps zones to fielding positions (cover, point, third-man, etc.)
  - Priority-based positioning (highest scoring zones first)
  - Coverage reasoning for each position

**Testing:**
- ✅ **15 unit tests passing** in test_tactical_suggestion_engine.py
- ✅ Test coverage includes:
  - Best bowler selection logic
  - Effectiveness scoring calculations
  - Weakness analysis detection
  - Dot ball strategy recommendations
  - Yorker weakness detection
  - Fielding position recommendations
  - Scoring zone analysis
  - Bowler profile metrics
  - Batter profile calculations

**Test Results:**
```
pytest backend/tests/ -k tactical -v
15 passed, 622 deselected
```

**Frontend Integration:**
- ✅ TypeScript composable: `useTacticalSuggestions.ts`
- ✅ Fully typed interfaces for all suggestion types
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Individual and combined fetch methods

### 📈 Progress Update
- Week 5 AI Integration: **7/14 features complete (50%)**
- Overall project: **66/96 tasks complete (68%)**

### 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Best bowler recommendation (current form + history vs batter)
- ✅ Weakness vs bowler type suggestions (pace/spin/yorker/dot-ball)
- ✅ Fielding setup recommendations (zone-based positioning)
- ✅ Confidence scoring for all suggestions
- ✅ API endpoints functional and tested

  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

**Weakness Analysis:**

  "primary_zone": "off-good",
  "recommended_positions": [
    {
      "position": "cover",
      "priority": 1,
      "coverage_reason": "Batter scores 1.8 runs/delivery here"
