## ✅ Week 5 AI Integration - Training Drill Suggestions

**Status:** This feature was already fully implemented prior to this PR.

### 🔍 Verification Completed

**Backend Implementation:**
- ✅ `TrainingDrillGenerator` service (350+ lines) - Comprehensive drill recommendation engine
- ✅ **Two API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /training/players/{id}/suggested-drills` - Individual player drill recommendations
  - `GET /training/games/{id}/team-{side}/suggested-drills` - Team-wide drill suggestions
- ✅ **8 Drill Categories:**
  - `PACE_HANDLING` - Coping with fast bowling
  - `SPIN_HANDLING` - Playing spin bowling
  - `DOT_BALL` - Surviving pressure situations
  - `AGGRESSIVE` - Scoring shots and acceleration
  - `BOUNDARY_HITTING` - Maximum scoring (sixes)
  - `WICKET_PROTECTION` - Avoiding dismissals
  - `FIELDING` - Defensive positioning
  - `ENDURANCE` - Fitness and stamina
- ✅ **20+ Drill Templates** with:
  - Drill name and detailed description
  - Duration in minutes (15-30 min typical)
  - Repetition count or delivery count
  - Focus area (skill being trained)
  - Difficulty rating (1-10 scale)
- ✅ **Weakness-to-Drill Mapping:**
  - `pace_weakness` → PACE_HANDLING drills (HIGH severity)
  - `spin_weakness` → SPIN_HANDLING drills (HIGH severity)
  - `dot_ball_weakness` → DOT_BALL drills (MEDIUM severity)
  - `yorker_weakness` → BOUNDARY_HITTING drills (HIGH severity)
  - `aggressive_weakness` → AGGRESSIVE drills (MEDIUM severity)
  - `boundary_weakness` → BOUNDARY_HITTING drills (MEDIUM severity)
- ✅ **Severity-Based Prioritization:**
  - HIGH priority (>70 weakness score) - Critical, needs immediate attention
  - MEDIUM priority (50-70) - Important skill gap
  - LOW priority (<50) - Minor improvement area
- ✅ **Drill Features:**
  - Personalized reason for recommendation
  - Recommended frequency (daily, 3x/week, weekly)
  - Expected improvement description
  - Weakness severity scoring
  - Confidence scoring (0-1)
  - Dismissal pattern detection integration

**Testing:**
- ✅ **22 unit tests passing** in test_training_drill_generator.py
- ✅ Test coverage includes:
  - Drill generation for players with weaknesses
  - Severity threshold detection (no drills for strong players)
  - Drill plan structure validation
  - Weakness-to-drill category mapping
  - Pace/spin/dot-ball/yorker drill recommendations
  - Dismissal pattern integration
  - Template validation

**Test Results:**
```
pytest backend/tests/ -k drill -v
32 passed (22 from training_drill_generator)
```
